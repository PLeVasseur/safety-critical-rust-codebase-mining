There are three kinds: associated constants, associated functions (including methods with self parameter), and associated types. iceoryx2 extensively uses all three, with particular emphasis on trait-based abstraction for IPC backends, Generic Associated Types (GATs) for reactor/guard patterns, and methods for the primary API.",
