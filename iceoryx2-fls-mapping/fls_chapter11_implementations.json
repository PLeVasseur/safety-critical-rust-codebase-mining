There are two kinds: inherent implementations (adding direct functionality) and trait implementations (adding functionality specified by a trait). iceoryx2 v0.8.0 uses 2,397 impl blocks total, with heavy use of trait implementations for abstraction and unsafe impl for Send/Sync markers on IPC and FFI types.",
